[Data Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/forest+fires)

To run the script you need Matlab installed

Feel free to run any script you like. They work and use each other's code in the following sequence:
1. First.m
2. Summary.m
3. Correlation.m
4. CorrelationFor20Samples.m
5. Fuzzify20.m
6. TestingFuzzy.m

## Notes:
1. Do **NOT** change the scripts names and do **NOT** change their directory because they are dependent on each other.
2. Do **NOT** delete the 20SamplesResults.mat file or change its directory.
